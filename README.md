# Design and Analysis of Algorithms Projects

Welcome to the repository for the projects created during the Design and Analysis of Algorithms course at Karachi Institute of Economics and Technology (KIET). This repository includes both the main project, which covers examples discussed during lectures, and supplementary exercises. Additionally, there is a Groupify project designed to create groups of students using various algorithmic strategies.

## Main Project

The main project in this repository encompasses examples and applications discussed during the Design and Analysis of Algorithms lectures. You'll find comprehensive implementations, explanations, and analyses of various algorithmic concepts covered in the course.

## Supplementary Exercises

This project contains examples and applications not discussed directly during the lectures, but are there to aid in building the required competency step-by-step. There are short videos on respective playlist on my [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_CWiEM1BBo&list=PLbbnsfsaJoH8MX2rnIueuhPlpnvWFclj0) channel describing these exercises.

## Groupify Project

Groupify project is a specific use case to form project groups of 3 or 4 students from the class using various criteria and design strategies. Please refer to the lecture slides to understand the main objectives.
